# Admin law application for international organizations

## Summary

Application to reliably search and extract information on case law of Administrative Tribunals of International Organizations and to help draft case related research and submission documents for use in administrative tribunal proceedings. 
International organizations usually have their own internal administrative law procedures with an administrative tribunal being the highest instance, e.g. ILOAT, UNAT, ADBAT, WBAT, IMFAT, etc. 

Building AI course project

## How is it used?

This would be useful for admin lawyers in international organizations as well as for claimants who seek to evaluate their chances of escalating a case to a tribunal. 

## Data sources and AI methods
The decisions are publicly available, but in different formats and in English or French. It is difficult to do comprehensive research across different tribunals although they often deal with similar issues based on similar rules. AI that has been trained on all decisions of all such tribunals may be better able to compile information across tribunals and cases without having to do extensive research.

## Challenges

Most importantly for legal AI application is that hallucination has to be kept to the absolute minimum. Content needs to be properly verified. It is also a challenge to extract all the information from various tribunals and unifying the formats and content. Also, decisions may be based on the evaluation of internal rules of organizations. These rules are usually not publicly available and may change over time. 

## What next?

Initially, it needs to be scoped out how data sources can be scraped and unified in a specific, searchable database. This includes ability to extract non-formatted information from PDFs. An appropriate AI software engine needs to be determined to feed all the information into. It will require extensive testing to ensure that hallucinations are eliminated to the extent possible.
